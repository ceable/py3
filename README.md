# Python3.x seed-code
Starter boilerplate for python3.x projects complete with **git-hooks** that trigger
the linter to format the code before committing changes.

### CHANGELOG:
- [x] Using `pre-commit` git-hooks
- [x] ~Using **Black** is rigid, highly opinionated. Dismissed~
- [x] ~Same relative rigidity for `autopep8`, `flake8`, or any PEP8-compliant linter~
- [x] Linting with `yapf` and `pylint`
- [ ] Customize `.pylintrc` config
