# Python3 Starter Code

Starter boilerplate for python3 projects

#### Project structure:

```bash
<root>/.
├── iter.py
├── LICENSE

> Note: The `iter.py` file is availed for demo purposes. **It can safely be deleted**.

### Instructions

Clone this repo and rename the root folder to anything you want. Immediately start writing code.

To fully take advantage of what's in here, we recommend installing a few packages, and commit the folder to versioning with Git, as follows:

```bash
pip install -U pre-commit pylint autopep8
git init
pre-commit install
git add .
git commit -m "Message"
```

Git hooks are a great way to perform last-minute checks when committing changes. They automatically block the commit process in order to do a few things as pre-determined by you. For starters this boilerplate simply lints all staged python files.

### LICENSE

See `./LICENSE` file.
